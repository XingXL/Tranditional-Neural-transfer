Tranditional-Neural-transfer
========
In order to classify the papers I have read, I treated the articles in the following list as trandition-neural-transder, just for research convenience.
1. A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style(https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)
2. Demystifying Neural Style Transfer(https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01036)
3. Stable and Controllable Neural Texture Synthesis and Style Transfer Using Histogram Losses(https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08893)
4. Combining Markov Random Fields and Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Synthesis(https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04589)
5.
